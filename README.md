# Introduction
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects."
 In OOP, we think about a program as a collection of objects that interact with each other to perform 
 tasks.

# When & How to use

## What is opp
- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm that organizes software 
  design around the concept of objects. In OOP, an object is an instance of a class that encapsulates
  data and behavior. Objects can interact with each other by sending messages, and they can inherit
  attributes and behavior from parent classes.
- in another words: we think about a program as a collection of objects that interact with each other  
  to perform tasks. Each object has some data that describes its state, and some methods that describe
  its behavior.


## why we use oop
- We use OOP because it helps us write code that is easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.
- OOP lets us group related data and functions together into objects, which can make our code more 
  organized and modular.
